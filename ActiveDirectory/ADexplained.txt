Active Directory serves as a foundational technology, enabling network administrators to efficiently create and manage domains, users, and objects within a network. It is engineered to scale, facilitating the organization of an extensive number of users into manageable groups and subgroups, while controlling access rights at various levels.

The structure of Active Directory is comprised of three primary layers: domains, trees, and forests. A domain encompasses a collection of objects, such as users or devices, sharing a common database. Trees are groups of these domains linked by a shared structure, and a forest represents the collection of multiple trees, interconnected through trust relationships, forming the uppermost layer of the organizational structure. Specific access and communication rights can be designated at each of these levels.

Key concepts within Active Directory include:

    Directory – Houses all information pertaining to Active Directory objects.

    Object – Denotes entities within the directory, including users, groups, or shared folders.

    Domain – Serves as a container for directory objects, with the capability for multiple domains to coexist within a forest, each maintaining its own object collection.

    Tree – A grouping of domains that share a common root domain.

    Forest – The pinnacle of organizational structure in Active Directory, composed of several trees with trust relationships among them.
