# Windows-Active-direktory-thesis

In this GitHub repository, I will guide you through the process of setting up a vulnerable Active Directory on a Windows Server 2019. I will also show you some of the common attacks that this AD environment is vulnerable to, and explain how to implement the appropriate protections to secure it.
