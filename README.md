# Windows-Active-direktory-thesis

In this GitHub repository, I will guide you through the process of setting up a vulnerable Active Directory on a Windows Server 2019. I will also show you some of the common attacks that this AD environment is vulnerable to, and explain how to implement the appropriate protections to secure it.

[!IMPORTANT]  
The thesis is still a work in progress.

## Setting Up the Environment

To get started, please refer to the following setup instructions:

- **[Kali Linux Setup Guide](setup/kaliSetUp.md)**: Steps for setting up Kali Linux for penetration testing.
- **[Windows 2019 VM Setup Guide](setup/windows2019VMsetup.md)**: Instructions for configuring a Windows Server 2019 VM to run Active Directory.

These setup guides are located in the `setup` directory, which is essential for getting the vulnerable Active Directory environment up and running.
