# Hardening your SMB configuration
When running smbclient -L 192.168.56.107 -U "" we got all usergrups as an output.
Becouse SMBv1 is outdated and highly insecure, making it easy to enumerate shares. Disabling it will prevent older clients and tools from connecting using vulnerable methods.

so we should disable it by running Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName SMB1Protocol -Remove
Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB2Protocol $true

# Enable SMB Signing

SMB signing helps prevent tampering and man-in-the-middle attacks. It can also block certain tools
Set-SmbServerConfiguration -RequireSecuritySignature $true
Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSecuritySignature $true

#Disable annonymus accsess to File shares
Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options
